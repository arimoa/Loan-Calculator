# Loan-Calculator
## About
In this program, the user can calculate the monthly payment amount by entering the loan amount, interest percentage, and the number of payment months. The number displayed to him/her is live and the displayed amount changes live by changing each field.

Keep in mind that if the loan amount is less than zero, or the interest rate is less than zero or greater than 100, or the number of months entered is less than 1, the program will display a related error to the user.
